# Requirements specification on AGILE projects

Projects following agile development cycles take a variety of approaches to specifying requirements that is different

Many agile projects employ **user stories** during elicitation. Each user story is a statement of a user need or functionality that might be valuable to the user or purchaser or the system.

Team might begin specification on agile projects by writing just enough information for each user story so that the stakeholders have a general understanding of the story and can prioritize it.

User stories are accumulated and prioritized into a dynamic product backlog that evoles throughout the project.

User stories are can be recored on something as simple as index cards instead of a traditional document.

Only the stories that are being worked on are fleshed out, usually in the form of acceptance tests that describe how the system will behave if the story is properly implemented.

> If the team elects to discard the original user stories, then the only persistent document tation of the requirements is likely to be the acceptance tests, if they are stored in a tool.

Nonfunctional requirements can be written on cards not as user stories but as constraints. Alternatively, teams might specify nonfunctional requirements that are associated with a specific user story in the form of acceptance criteria or tests, such as to demonstrate achievement of specific quality attribute goals.

The overarching goal of requirements development: to accumulate a shared understanding of requirements that is good enough to allow construction of the next portion of the product to proceed at an acceptable level of risk.
