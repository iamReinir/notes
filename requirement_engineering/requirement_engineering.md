## Requirement development

All activities involved with exploring, evaluation, documenting and confirming the requirement of a product.

- Elicitation : Exploring requirements
- Analysis : reaching a deeper and more precise understanding
- Specification : Documenting requirements
- Validation : Confirm that you have the correct set of requirements.

## The most important stage?

Elicitation - It's the first stage and is the basic for all others stage. If it's fucked, everything else is also fucked

Confusion about requirements terminology extends even to what to call the whole discipline. Some authors call the entire domain requirements engineering. Others refer to it all as requirements management. Still others refer to these activities as a subset of the broad domain of business analysis.

Requirements management activities include the following:
Defining the requirements baseline
Evaluating the impact of proposed requirements changes and incorporating approved changes into the project in a controlled way
Keeping project plans current with the requirements as they evolve
Negotiating new commitments based on the estimated impact of requirements changes
Defining the relationships and dependencies that exist between requirements
Tracing individual requirements to their corresponding designs, source code, and tests
Tracking requirements status and change activity throughout the project
