# Who should be a decision makers in a Software project?

There is no single correct answer as to who should make key decisions. It's different per project. However, _**a small group represent key areas - management, customers, business analysis, development and marketing - generally work best**_

The decision-making group needs to identify its decision leader and to select a decision rule, which describes how they will arrive at their decisions. There are numerous decision rules to choose from, including the following (Gottesdiener 2001):

- The decision leader makes the choice, either with or without discussion with others.
- The group votes and the majority rules.
- The group votes, but the result must be unanimous to approve the decision.
- The group discusses and negotiates to reach a consensus. Everyone can live with the decision
  and commits to supporting it.
- The decision leader delegates authority for making the decision to one individual.
- The group reaches a decision, but some individual has veto authority over that decision.

There is no globally correct or appropriate decision rule. A single decision rule won’t work in every situation.
