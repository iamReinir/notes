# Requirement baseline

## **A requirements baseline is a set of requirements that has been reviewed and agreed upon and serves as the basis for further development.**

Whether your team uses a formal sign-off process or some other means of reaching agreement on requirements, the subtext of that agreement should read something like this:

> “I agree that this set of requirements represents our best understanding of the requirements for the next portion of this project and that the solution described will meet our needs as we understand them today.
> I agree to make future changes in this baseline through the project’s defined change process.
> I realize that changesmight require us to renegotiate cost, resource, and schedule commitments.”

Some organizations put text like this right on the signature page, so the requirement approvers know exactly what sign-off means in their world.

# Why requirement baseline is important

A shared understanding along these lines helps reduce the friction that can arise as requirements oversights are revealed or marketplace and business demands evolve over the course of the project.

A meaningful baselining process gives all the major stakeholders confidence in the following ways:

- Customer management or marketing is confident that the project scope won’t explode out of control, because customers manage the scope change decisions.
- User representatives have confidence that the development team will work with them to deliver the right solution, even if they didn’t think of every requirement before construction began.
- Development management has confidence because the development team has a business partner who will keep the project focused on achieving its objectives and will work with development to balance schedule, cost, functionality, and quality.
- Business analysts and project managers are confident that they can manage changes to the project in a way that will keep chaos to a minimum.
- Quality assurance and test teams can confidently develop their test scripts and be fully prepared for their project activities
