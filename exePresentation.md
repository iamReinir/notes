# Competition in the start-up world

Many entrepreneurs just do not enter the market because of this excess fear that how they will compete while there are many others in the market.

let me tell you some of the main concerns:

 - What will happen if someone launches the same idea before I do?
 - What will happen if I would not be able to attract the required audience?
 - What will happen if a competitor launches something greater than my product?

Competition will always be there. The use of solid strategies and practical experiences and lessons would further make your journey easier and successful.

## Focus on your own goal

Focus is the most important factor to make your success to happen. You need to shut all the distractions and develop a sense of focus on the thing you really want to construct.

If you are not clear on your part than every other tiny thing would influence your strategies and your campaign.

Sometimes too much information becomes a source of  distraction as well because when you are occupied with random thoughts which are irrelevant, you tend to lose the pace at which you should be working.

## Understand the Market and Competitors

Market Research: Understand the needs, wants, and behaviors of your target customers.Having a deep know-how about your market and the audience lets you grab the market in the most efficient way. You should take the important steps at the right time before your competitors.

Competitor Analysis: Identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of your competitors. Knowing what your competitors do well and not so well can help you find ways to outperform them.

By learning about the competitive environment you will learn the do’s and don’ts necessary to survive in the industry.

## Identify and Focus on Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Clear USP: Ensure your product or service has a distinct and unique value that customers can't find elsewhere.

Strong Branding: Build a strong and consistent brand to stand out in the market.

## Never make ‘Bad Publicity’ your tool:

Another important point which you should consider is not to adopt the ‘Defaming Competitors’ strategy.

Some entrepreneurs try to do bad publicity of entrepreneurs but in my opinion you can’t achieve anything out of it because this speaking ill of other brands will never make your own brand shine any brighter, instead it will bring out your own perspective as an entrepreneur.

## Remain Calm and Confident:

The last strategy which is a must to follow is to always be confident on whatever you are doing.

If you are confident about your brand no matter at what stage it is, then no competitor can be a source of threat for you, because you are doing your best and remaining calm.
