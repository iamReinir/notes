# Test design techniques

## Identifying test conditions and designing test cases

There are three things we need to know first before even start testing:
- Test conditions (doc in a Test Design Specification)
- Test cases (doc in a Test Case Specification)
- Test procedures (or scripts) (doc in a Test Procedure Specification)

Each is specified in its own document, according to the Test Documentation Standard (IEEE 829)

## Formality of test documentation

Testing maybe performed with varying degrees of formality. 

Very formal testing would have extensive documentation which is well controlled and would expect the documented detail of the tests to include the exact and specific input and expected output of the test.

Very informal testing may have no documentation at all, or only notes kept by individual testers.

The right level of formality is depend on your context
