| **Definition**      | Server sends data to the client proactively.    | Client requests data from the server as needed.  |
| **Initiation**      | Server initiates communication.                 | Client initiates communication.                   |
| **Direction**       | Server to client.                               | Client to server.                                 |
| **Real-time**       | Suitable for real-time updates and notifications.| Suitable for on-demand data retrieval.           |
| **Advantages**      | - Immediate updates.<br>- Efficient for live data.<br>- Minimizes client-side processing.<br>- Reduces latency for critical updates. | - Saves bandwidth by fetching only necessary data.<br>- Allows caching of data for offline use.<br>- Client controls when to fetch data.<br>- Suitable for non-real-time applications. |
| **Disadvantages**    | - Potential for data overload.<br>- Server must handle multiple connections.<br>- May not be suitable for slow or intermittent networks. | - May introduce latency for real-time updates.<br>- Requires more client-side processing.<br>- Data might become stale if not refreshed frequently. |
| **Usage Scenario**   | - Instant messaging.<br>- Live sports updates.<br>- Stock price notifications.<br>- Real-time monitoring systems. | - Web browsing.<br>- Database querying.<br>- File downloading.<br>- Content management systems. |
