# The Agile Manifesto
## Four Values
* **Individuals and Interactions**	over	Processes and Tools
* **Working software** 	over	Comprehensive documentation
* **Customer Collaboration** 	over 	Contract Negotiation
* **Responding to change** 	over 	following a plan

## Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver of working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and the support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficent and effective method of conveying information to and within a dev team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more efective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

# Agile is :

* Validate user's needs earlier
* Detect intergration issues early
## Cons
* Architecture, Design, Database modelling is challenging
* Lack of control / unpredictable journey -> very uncomfortable for leaders/organizations
* Requires participation from customers throughout the development process.

## When to use AGILE
* Agile is good for projects of all size. However, it is not good for repetitive, repeatable work.
* Agile need close collaboration with businesses, users
