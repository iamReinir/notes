# Spiral model - a risk driven model

## Four basic steps per cycle
1. Determine
	* Objectives
	* Constraints
	* Alternatives
2. Identify and resolve risks.
3. Development and test.
4. Plan the next iteration.
	review work done and commitment for next iteration.

## Track progress through milestones
* LifeCycle Objective : sufficient definition of technical and management approach
* Life Cycle Architecture : sufficient definition of the preferred approach + significant risks eliminated/mitigrated
* Initial Operational capability : sufficient preparation of te software, site, users, operators and maintainers.

## Characteristic
* Risk driven
* Effort and Detail driven by risk.
* It's a process model generator : Other model will be used in each phase.

### Quite Adaptive model.

## Pros
* Adaptive
* Risk focused
* Flexible : can use any other model
* Minimize waste
* option to go/no-go

## Cons
* Complicated
* Cost more to manage
* Need stakeholder involvement
