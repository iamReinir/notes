# Waterfall development model

# Desc
Requirement -> Design -> implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance
Happen is a sequence.
If faults are found, go back one phase to check, repeat if needed.
later faults found, more costly it will be.

# When to use
1. The requirement are solid
2. Team has experience building similar software.
3. Translation of requirement -> product is going to be perfect.

## Very predictive model

# Pros
* Simple
* Predictability
* Efficient

# Cons
* Not flexible to change
* First release take a long time.
