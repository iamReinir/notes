# Abstraction - how can we understand the world without going crazy

> [useful resource](https://thevaluable.dev/abstraction-type-software-example/)

In short, an abstraction will simplify a process or artifact, by providing what you really need, and hiding the useless details you donâ€™t care.

Three main properties of an abstraction:
* The concept of hiding, or removing.
* The concept of generalization.
* The concept of idea versus reality.
