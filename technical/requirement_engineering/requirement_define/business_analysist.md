Business analyst is a project role, not necessarily a job title. Synonyms for business analyst include requirements analyst, systems analyst, requirements engineer, requirements manager, application analyst, business systems analyst, IT business analyst, and simply analyst. These job titles are used inconsistently from organization to organization.

## The making of a business analyst

- The former user

  > They understand the business and the work environment, and they speak user's language.
  > However, they need to know more about software engineering and how to communicate with technical people.

- The former developer or tester

  > Project managers who lack a dedicated BA often expect a developer to do the job.
  > The developer-turned-analyst might need to learn more about the business domain. Developers can easily lapse into technical thinking and jargon, focusing on the software to be built instead of
  > the customers’ needs. They’ll need to get up to speed on current best practices for requirements
  > engineering.

  > Testers aren’t commonly asked to perform the analyst role. However, a tester often has an
  > analytical mindset that can lend itself to being a good BA. Testers are already used to thinking about
  > exceptions and how to break things, a useful skill for finding gaps in requirements.
