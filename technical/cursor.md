### Rules

*Control how the Agent model behaves with reusable, scoped instructions.*

Rules provide system-level instructions to Agent and Inline Edit. Think of them as persistent context, preferences, or workflows for your projects. 

Cursor supports four types of rules:

- **Project Rules**: Stored in .cursor/rules, version-controlled and scoped to your codebase.
- **User Rules**: Global to your Cursor environment. Defined in settings and always applied.
- **AGENTS.md** Agent instructions in markdown format. Simple alternative to .cursor/rules.
- **.cursorrules** (Legacy) Still supported, but deprecated. Use Project Rules instead.

## Productivity Benefits

- Learn APIs/libraries quickly
- Automate repetitive edits
- Focus on logic, not boilerplate

## Best Practices
