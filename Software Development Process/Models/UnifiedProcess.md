https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-unified-process-model

## inception
* Short phase
* Establish business case, scope
* Feasiblity
* Build vs. Buy
* Preliminary Schedule and Cost
### Milestone : Lifecycle Objective - The organization is commited to this project

## Elaboration
* Capture Requirements
* Address known risks
* Validate the system architecture
* Executable Architecture Baseline (make a prototype)
### Milestone : Lifecycle Architecture - commited to this Architecture

## Construction
* Large Phase
* Software is built
* Multiple iterations, each results in releast
* Iterative or Incremental, or both.
### Milestone : Inital Operational Capability 

## Transition 
* Deployment
* Get feedback and refine
* System conversion and user training

### This is a framework that incorporates other methods/model.
### Any step may invole different kinds of work (requirements, design..) but emphasis might be different.
### Architecture Centric
### Use case Centric
### Focus on rist mitigation

## This model is quite adaptive.

## Pros
* Adaptive
* Quality and Resuability
* Focus on risk mitigation
* Flexible, can incorporate other SW dev models

## Cons
* Complicated
* Need more resources
* Too much overhead for smaller project

## Where to use:
* Big and risky projects
* All requirements are not known early
* Desire to deliver value early

Variants:
Rational Unified Process - RAP
Enterprise Unified Process
Open UP - Lighter
Agile UP - Lighter, Agile focus.
