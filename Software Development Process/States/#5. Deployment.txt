You should have a backup plan.

## Cutover Strategies
1. Cold back-up : A server lied inactived that will be turned on and deloyed on when the main server is dead.
2. Warm standby : A running machine (that could have all the installers or not), that will be run and redirected to when the server is down. Faster than Cold-backup
3. Hot failover : A failover server thats constantly running, replicate the data from the main server.
