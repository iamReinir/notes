# SWT test 1

Defect Management process does not include:

- Deliverable base-lining

???

Not a static testing technique

- Error guessing: this is more-or-less a black-box technique used by veterans

Component Testing is also called

- Component testing also called unit test, program testing, or module testing

Verification can be termed as "are we building the product right?"

- True. "Are we building the right product" is validation

The vendor contractor to write the initial scripts ???

1. Measuring response time
2. Measuring transaction rates
3. Recovery testing
4. Simulation many users
5. Generation many transactions [x]

- Found this on Quizlet, dunno right or not.

The number of tests to test all control statements equals to the cyclomatic complexity?

- Dunno, should be false. Cyclomatic complexity should be the minimum number of tests to cover all branches
- Basic path testing or structured testing : analyse the control flow graph of a program to find a set of linearly independent path of execution. This set size <= cyclomatic complexity
- Branch coverage : all edges of the control flow graph.
- An independent path is one that introduces at least one new edge that has not been traversed before the path is created.

Which tools would be involved in the automation of regression test?

- Output comparator

Peer reviews are also called :

- Technical Review

What information not to include in a test incident report

- How to fix the fault

Values less than 10 are rejected, values between 10 and 21 are accepted, rest are rejected. Choose input values that cover all of the equivalence partitions:

- 3, 10, 22

When a new testing tool is pruchased, it should be used first by:

- A small team to establish the best way to use the tool

Testing account to what precent of software development costs?

- 40 - 50%

Exit Criteria consist of

- [x] Thoroughness measures such as code coverage, functionality coverage or risk coverage.

---

Which is not the software characteristcs

- Development cost

Software quality is not relevant to ??

1. Correctness
2. Usability
3. Viability [x]
4. Resuability

Defect discovered by static analysis tools:

- unused variable
- Security vulnerabilities ???
- Programming standard violations
- uncalled function and procedures

Benefits of independent testing

- see other and different defect and are unbiased

Most likely to achieved using test tools

- Easy to access information about tests and testing. [x]
- Reduced maintenance of testware
- Easy and cheap to implement
- Greater consistency of tests [x]

Capture and replay facilities are least likely to be used to:

(recovery testing??)

- GUI testing

The tool modifies the program code of manipulates the operation environment in an non-invasive ??????

- False

Typical defect discoverd by static analysis:

- Programing standard violations
- Refering undefined variables
- Security vulnerabilities

Type of test to verify that the system can perform properly when internal program limitation have been exceeded

- Stress testing

People dont participate in technical reviews

- Management

Major task of test planning

- Scheduling test analysis and design tasks

Which test case result in VALID

4. 23 yo class A prenium 0 excess 500

With thorough testing it is possible to remove all defect from a program prior to delivery

- False

When do you stop testing

- When Test completion criteria are met

Regresstion testing always involves

- Testing whether modifications have introduced adverse side effect

Test case are grouped into manageable and scheduled units called

- Test suite

An important criterion in deciding what testing technique to use:

- The objective of the test
