# Last words to a world

So, four years ago, I decided to enter this "world" with my partner. He can't, for the life of him, choose anything, so I stepped in. I figured I could make do with anything it threw at us. In fact, I would very much want it to throw everything it had at us, because, you know, you can't really avoid struggle, might as well choose one worth fighting for. My partner had always been bad with changes, and that time was no different. However, he can't really go against external pressure, so like it or not, off to the place we went.

First time out of our usual place. Should be sentimental? Sure, but I couldn't remember. Maybe he did. I did the preparations so nothing went wrong. I figured our time in this world would look like our previous years. The place was, actually, not that different than what we used to deal with. People still see me as a small helpless girl who can't do a thing and always stick to Mr.Partner (TM) like glue, cyanoacrylate glue, to be specific. And they always befriend him, only him, and consider me a nice accessory or a nuisance, depending on the weather.

That had always been the case. I am much smaller than him. I need him to survive. He can talk, I cannot. He can score excellently on all those tests people said were "very important". He can remember things, I can't even remember what time we wake up this mornning. FFS, I can't even go anywhere without him. The moment I put my hand on the steering wheel, the car crashes. *He's normal, I'm the weird one.* But, we both know that I won't ever need to put my hand on the steering wheel, the car moves much faster under him anyway. I only need to show him directions. He dealt with things I cannot deal with, I solved things he cannot solve, that's what made us strong.

With that in mind, we breezed through the years. Or that would have been the plan.

In the years following that, we met others. Some close to me, some were not. To my surprise, not all of them were put off by me. (The one who left the biggest impression on me was a girl with clothes made of lead and a wood mask. We were not on good terms, at all, which is a first to me. My partner always has someone to spite. It just is not the case that I also avoid that person). Anyway, hated or loved, I am grateful to everyone. Meeting them was like a blessing to me.

And then we reached this day, when we had to leave the world. I will remember it dearly, all goods and bads.

And I think I'm almost as tall as my partner!
