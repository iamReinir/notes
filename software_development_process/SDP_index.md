# Software development process
Ways to develop Software

## Development models
* [Waterfall](models/waterfall.md) : The traditional model. Used for predictable projects
* [Sashimi](models/sashimi.md) : Like waterfall, but pharses are crunched together
* [V-model](models/v-model.md) : Like, waterfall, but emphasize on testing and verify.
* [Incremental](models/incremental.md) : A type of development emphasizes on early delivery.
* [Unified Process](models/unifiedProcess.md) : A Framework that can incoporate other models. More adaptive.
* [Spiral model](models/spiral.md) : Risk driven process model generator
* [AGILE](models/AGILE/manifesto.md) : Modern takes on software development

## Models' attributes
* [Adaptive vs. Predictive](models/predictive_adaptive.md)
* [Incremental vs. Iterative](models/incremental_iterative.md)

## States of development
* [Requirement](states/requirement.md)
* [Architecture](states/architecture.md)
* [Design](states/design.md)
* [Implementation](states/implementation.md)
* [Testing](states/testing.md)
